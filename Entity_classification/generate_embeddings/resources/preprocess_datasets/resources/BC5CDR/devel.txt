Tacrolimus	B-Chemical

However,	O

Herein	O
we	O
describe	O
transient	O
myocardial hypertrophy	B-Disease
induced	O
by	O
tacrolimus	B-Chemical
after	O
heart	O
transplantation.	O
The	O
hypertrophy	B-Disease
caused	O
no	O
clinical	O

but	O
was	O
noted	O
because	O
of	O
elevation	O

and	O
confirmed	O
at	O

Initially,	O

;	O
neither	O

The	O
blood	O
tacrolimus	B-Chemical

was	O
higher	O

at	O
that	O
time;	O
thus,	O
tacrolimus	B-Chemical

Myocardial hypertrophy	B-Disease
completely	O
resolved	O

did	O
not	O
recur,	O
as	O

Thus,	O
we	O
conclude	O
that	O

In	O

however,	O

In	O

the	O

caused	O
a	O
