A	O

However,	O

INTERPRETATION:	O

Recently,	O

However,	O

We	O

whether	O

METHOD:	O

FINDINGS:	O

INTERPRETATION:	O
Tranexamic acid	B-Chemical

BACKGROUND:	O
Glioblastoma	B-Disease
is	O
a	O
malignant tumor	B-Disease
that	O
occurs	O
in	O
the	O
cerebrum	O
during	O
adulthood.	O
With	O
current	O
treatment	O
regimens	O
including	O
combined	O
surgery,	O
radiation	O
and	O
chemotherapy,	O
the	O
average	O
life	O
expectancy	O
of	O
the	O
patients	O
is	O
limited	O
to	O
approximately	O
1	O
year.	O
Therefore,	O
patients	O
with	O
glioblastoma	B-Disease
sometimes	O
have	O
intracarotid	O
injection	O
of	O
carcinostatics	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
treatment	O
regimen.	O
Generally,	O
carboplatin	B-Chemical

to	O
have	O
milder	O
side	O
effects	O
than	O
cisplatin	B-Chemical
,	O
whose	O
ocular and orbital toxicity	B-Disease
are	O
well	O
known.	O
However,	O
we	O
experienced	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
severe	O
ocular and orbital toxicity	B-Disease
after	O
intracarotid	O
injection	O
of	O
carboplatin	B-Chemical
,	O
which	O
is	O
infrequently	O
reported.	O
CASE:	O
A	O
58-year-old	O
man	O
received	O
an	O
intracarotid	O
injection	O
of	O
carboplatin	B-Chemical
for	O
recurrent	O
glioblastomas	B-Disease
in	O
his	O
left	O

He	O
complained	O
of	O
pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye	B-Disease
30	O
h	O
after	O
the	O
injection.	O
Various	O
ocular	O
symptoms	O
and	O
findings	O
caused	O
by	O
carboplatin	B-Chemical

were	O
seen.	O
RESULTS:	O
He	O
was	O

and	O
glycerin	B-Chemical
for	O
6	O

Although	O
the	O

by	O
secondary	O

decreased	O

diminished,	O
inexorable	O
papilledema	B-Disease

Finally,	O

later,	O
diffuse	O

the	O

CONCLUSION:	O
When	O

that	O

that	O

However,	O
one	O
drawback	O
of	O
such	O

is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

occur.	O
This	O

the	O

that	O

CONCLUSIONS:	O
The	O
data	O

that	O

plays	O
an	O
important	O
role	O
in	O
the	O

in	O

Because	O

a	O

occurs	O
to	O
reduce	O
injury to the brain	B-Disease

the	O

substantiate	O
the	O

that	O
