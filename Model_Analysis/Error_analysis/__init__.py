"""
This module performs evaluation of named entity recognition (NER) models by comparing predicted labels against true labels in biomedical datasets. The script includes functionalities for text preprocessing, handling cross-dataset evaluation, and generating detailed evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

    Dirs:
    
    	**Entity_classification** : Directory containing the scripts to perform the error profile comparison for entity classification task
    	
    	**NLI** : Directory containing the scripts to perform the error profile comparison for NLI task
    	
    	**Paraphrase Identification** : Directory containing the scripts to perform the error profile comparison for Identification task
    	
    	**results** : Directory where intermediate results would get saved.

    
    
    
    Files:
        **run.sh**: Bash script file to generate score file using all the ground truths.
